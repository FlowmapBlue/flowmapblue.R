Description: Create interactive flow maps using `FlowmapBlue` 'TypeScript'
    library <https://github.com/FlowmapBlue/FlowmapBlue>, which is a free
    tool for representing aggregated numbers of movements between
    geographic locations as flow maps. It is used to visualize urban
    mobility, commuting behavior, bus, subway and air travels, bicycle
    sharing, human and bird migration, refugee flows, freight
    transportation, trade, supply chains, scientific collaboration,
    epidemiological and historical data and many other topics. The package
    allows to either create standalone flow maps in form of 'htmlwidgets'
    and save them in 'HTML' files, or integrate flow maps into 'Shiny'
    applications.
